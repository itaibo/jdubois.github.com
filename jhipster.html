<h1>JHipster</h1>

<p>I am the creator and lead developer of JHipster.</p>

<p>
  JHipster is a development platform to generate Spring Boot + Angular/React/Vue.js projects. It is a very popular Open Source project, and you can find full information on the project on <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/" target="_blank">the JHipster homepage</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As part of my job at <a href="https://en.ippon.tech/" target="_blank">Ippon Technologies</a> I often do consulting, training, and presentations on JHipster. Don't hesitate to contact me if you are looking for JHipster expertise, I'm always happy to do both my work (for Ippon Technologies) and my passion (Open Source development).
