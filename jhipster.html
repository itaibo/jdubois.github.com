<h1>JHipster</h1>

<p>I am the creator and lead developer of JHipster.</p>

<p>
  JHipster is a <a href="http://yeoman.io" target="_blank">Yeoman generator</a>, used to create a Spring Boot + AngularJS project. You can find a lot of information on the project on <a href="http://jhipster.github.io/" target="_blank">the JHipster homepage</a>.
</p>

<p>
    As part of my job at <a href="http://www.ipponusa.com/" target="_blank">Ippon Technologies</a> I often do consulting, training, and presentations on JHipster. Don't hesitate to contact me if you are looking for JHipster expertise, I'm always happy to do both my work (for Ippon Technologies) and my passion (Open Source development).
